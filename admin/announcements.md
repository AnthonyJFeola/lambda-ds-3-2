# Class 1 Prep

```
Hey @channel, we're going to begin this sprint with an introduction to relational databases and SQL. To prepare for class, please:

    1) Download this example sqlite database called "chinook" (https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/), which we'll use to practice SQL queries.

    2) Optionally download and install this database management software called TablePlus (https://tableplus.com/) which will allow you to interface with the SQLite and PostgreSQL databases we'll be working with in this unit. FYI: TablePlus is my preferred / recommended tool these days, but you could always use alternative tools like DB Browser and/or PgAdmin instead, as referenced in the materials.
```
